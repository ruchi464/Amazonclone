# Amazonclone
ðŸš€ Built a responsive Amazon clone using HTML5, CSS3, and Tailwind CSS. It includes a navbar, banners, product sections, and mobile-friendly layouts. Used utility-first styling for clean, scalable design. This project sharpened my skills in modern UI/UX and responsive web development.
